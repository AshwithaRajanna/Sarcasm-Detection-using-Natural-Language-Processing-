The study presents an innovative approach to sarcasm detection in text using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It involves the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset comprising both sarcastic and non-sarcastic text samples from social media platforms and online forums. Key NLP techniques, including tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction, are used to prepare the textual data for model training. State-of-the-art machine learning models, including transformer-based architectures and deep neural networks, are leveraged for capturing intricate patterns and contextual cues indicative of sarcasm in text. Model training and evaluation focus on optimizing performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings demonstrate promising results in accurately identifying sarcastic statements with implications spanning various fields, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, sentiment analysis, and AI chatbot interactions. The research contributes to the broader advancement of NLP and machine learning applications, providing valuable insights for data science practitioners, linguists, and industry professionals engaged in human-computer interaction and sentiment analysis.
